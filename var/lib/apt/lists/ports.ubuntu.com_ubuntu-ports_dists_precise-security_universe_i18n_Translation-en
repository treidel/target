Description-en: multiuser MPM for Apache 2.2
 The ITK Multi-Processing Module (MPM) works in about the same way as the
 classical "prefork" module (that is, without threads), except that it allows
 you to constrain each individual vhost to a particular system user. This
 allows you to run several different web sites on a single server without
 worrying that they will be able to read each others' files. This is a
 third-party MPM that is not included in the normal Apache httpd.
 .
 Please note that this MPM is somewhat less tested than the MPMs that come with
 Apache itself.

Package: dtach
Description-md5: 4e883cf96c29b604bbef9999bb6833ef
Description-en: emulates the detach/attach feature of screen
 dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen,
 allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from
 the controlling terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep
 track of the contents of the screen, and thus works best with programs
 that know how to redraw themselves.
 .
 dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its
 support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This
 makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily
 audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in
 environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.

 easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban an

 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but configuration can be

    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages

      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      he sees are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy

      is compromised.

 (often backed by a database) before choosing either to render a
 template or redirecting to another action.

Package: swift
Description-md5: 7de15bde951264e5f9603202d2a74a72
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

Package: xdmx
Description-md5: d52dd645b5fa9daf3052065e2345991f
Description-en: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

 Xymon (previously called Hobbit) is a network- and applications-
 monitoring system designed for use in large-scale networks. But it will
 also work just fine on a small network with just a few nodes. It is
 low-overhead and high-performance, with an easy to use web front-end.
 It handles monitoring of network services, and through client packages
 it can also be used to monitor server- specific items.  Alerts can
 trigger when monitoring detects a problem, resulting in e-mails or
 calls to your pager or mobile phone.

Description-en: Xen Hypervisor on i386
 The hypervisor is the "core" for XEN itself.  It gets booted by the boot
 loader and controls cpu and memory, sharing them between your
 administrative domain (Domain 0) and the virtual guest systems.
 .
 In order to boot a XEN system along with this package you also need a
 kernel specifically crafted to work as the Domain 0, mediating hardware
 access for XEN itself.
